### Description
In this project, I will explore data on bike sharing systems for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York and Washington. the programming language to use for this project is python. I will first write a code to import the data and answer some interesting questions about it by calculating descriptive statistics and finally I will write a script that takes raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal in order to present these statistics.

### Files used
<<<<<<< HEAD
The datasets provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider in the US, contains randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities. The data files for all three cities contain the same core six columns:

    Start Time
    End Time
    Trip Duration
    Start Station
    End Station
    User Type

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

    Gender
    Birth Year
 
 ### Answering question
 
 hrough writing code, I'm able to answer the following questions about the bike share data:

    What month occurs most often in the start time?
    What day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) occurs most often in the start time?
    What hour of the day occurs most often in the start time?
    What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
    What is the most frequently used start station and most frequently used end station?
    What is the most common trip (i.e., the combination of start station and end station that occurs the most often)?
    What are the counts of each user type?
    What are the counts of gender?
    What is the earliest birth year (when the oldest person was born), most recent birth year, and most common birth year?
